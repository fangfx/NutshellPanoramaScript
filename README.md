# NutshellPanoramaScript

Bash script for generating a panorama out of 4 PNG images using Hugin tools

Written using the guidance of [this site](http://wiki.panotools.org/Panorama_scripting_in_a_nutshell)

###To Run:

Be sure to have exactly four png files in the directory of the bash script.

    ./nutshell.sh myfilename.pto myOutputNameWithNoExtension

Arguments are not required.

###Examples:

...are on the way.  ~~I will take some pictures over the weekend to show how the script works.~~
Apparently it's really hard to find a fisheye lens outside of a very dedicated population.  The specs for the pictures are: 
- ~95 degrees viewing angle
- taken at cardinal directions
- saved as PNGs in the same folder as the script

My next step for this project would probably to make it work for pictures taken by a phone.
